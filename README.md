# Dor

Dor is an IoT device used to grant users physical access via generation of random keycodes.

## Getting Started

#Hardware Setup
Our device is the the Adafruit Feather ESP8266 https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-huzzah-esp8266. 
We are also using 4 generic push-buttons and 1 programmable LED. If you are using a different board, you will need to change the pin numbers in the code.

#Device Software Setup
We will be using the Arduino IDE to program the board. First, put the DebouncedButton library in your Arduino libraries folder. For Mac users this is at ~/Documents/Arduino/libraries/, and for Windows users, this is at My Documents\Arduino\libraries\ by default. Restart the Arduino IDE.

Then open iothacks.ino in Arduino, compile, and upload the code to the board.


## Built With

* Arduino IDE 
* Node.js
* Angular JS
* POSTGRES DB
